### Dependency

The code is built with following libraries:

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.7.1
- [face_alignment](https://github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment)


### Dataset
- CelebA (for training)
- LFW (for testing) 

### Before training

We divide the CelebA dataset into training set and test set according to the identity of subjects. The images used for training are list in for example identity.txt in the following form:
```bash
image_name1.jpg label1
image_name2.jpg label2
```

Then read the identity.txt to load the images for training.

The images need to be pre-aligned before training. We use FAN [1] to align all images in CelebA and LFW according to the position of the eyesã€‚


### Training 

- To train IP-CFR using the train script simply specify the parameters listed in **train.py** as a flag or manually change them.
We provide the example of training on CelebA dataset with this repo:
```bash
python train.py --root_path="E:\data"
		--dataset_name="prepared_image/img_align_celeba_crop" \
		--dataset_label="prepared_image/identity_CelebA.txt" \
		
```

### Evaluation
If the input is a single partial image, use FAN (the face_alignment function) to find the position of the existing face informace. Then align it to the corresponding position of the training images.
